# Using the Roku Apps

This page covers the day-to-day Roku experience after the companion and profiles are already set up.

For companion setup and profile editing, see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md), [Configuration](./configuration.md), and [Using the Companion](./companion-app.md).

## Channel vs Screensaver

The Roku channel is used for setup, profile selection, and normal playback.

The Roku screensaver uses the same companion connection, but it behaves a little differently:

- It does not show the discovery or manual setup flow.
- If no screensaver profile is selected yet, it falls back to the channel profile.
- If no profile is configured at all, it shows a setup reminder and exits.
- If the companion is rebuilding a playlist and a cached playlist exists, the screensaver uses the cached playlist immediately.

## First-Run Flow

1. Open **Immich Lounge** on your Roku.
2. Enter the companion host and keep port `4383`.
3. Select the profile you want for the channel.
4. Start playback and confirm the slideshow is working.
5. If you also want the screensaver, go to `Settings` -> `Theme` -> `Screensavers` and switch the active screensaver to **Immich Lounge Screensaver**.
6. After it is selected, open **Configure Screensaver** to choose the companion and profile for screensaver mode.

## Change the Roku Screensaver

Use Roku system settings to change which screensaver the device runs:

1. Go back to the Roku home screen.
2. Open **Settings**.
3. Open **Theme**, then **Screensavers**.
4. Set the active screensaver to **Immich Lounge Screensaver**.
5. Open **Configure Screensaver**.
6. Confirm the companion URL, then choose the profile you want the screensaver to use.

Roku's support article for changing screensavers is here: [How to change the screensaver on your Roku streaming device](https://support.roku.com/article/212015418).

If **Immich Lounge Screensaver** is already selected, you only need **Configure Screensaver** to switch it to a different companion or profile.

## Remote Controls

In channel mode:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| `Left` | Previous photo |
| `Right` | Next photo |
| `OK` | Show or hide the overlay |
| `Up` | Show the overlay |
| `Down` | Hide the overlay |
| `Play/Pause` | Pause or resume playback |
| `*` | Open the settings menu |
| `Back` | Open the exit dialog |

In screensaver mode, Roku handles key presses at the system level and the screensaver exits instead of opening app controls.

## Roku Settings Menu

Press `*` during playback in the channel to open the settings dialog.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Refresh Now` | Re-fetches the current profile and playlist immediately. |
| `Change Profile` | Keeps the companion URL but lets you pick a different profile for channel mode. |
| `Change Companion` | Switches the Roku to a different companion host. |
| `Clear Cache` | Removes cached profile and playlist data for the current mode. |

## Typical Setup Patterns

- Use one profile for the channel and another for the screensaver if you want different rooms or moods.
- Use the channel for setup and troubleshooting, even if your main goal is the screensaver.
- If the companion host changes, use **Change Companion** from the Roku settings menu instead of reinstalling the apps.

## When to use the channel for troubleshooting

Prefer the normal channel when you need to:

- confirm the companion URL
- switch profiles
- force a refresh
- clear cached state

The screensaver is best treated as playback-only once it is configured.
