# Configuration

<div class="section-intro">
Most users only need three things here: connect the companion to immich, create one or more profiles, and tune how the slideshow should look on Roku.
</div>

For the companion pages you use after setup, see [Using the Companion](./companion-app.md).

For channel controls, profile switching on the Roku, cache clearing, and screensaver behavior after setup, see [Using the Roku Apps](./roku-apps.md).

## Connection settings

These settings are shared by every profile:

- friendly name
- immich server URL
- immich API key

After saving, use **Test Connection** to make sure the companion can reach immich.

> **Security note:** The companion is for trusted home networks. It does not provide public-internet authentication.

## Profiles

A profile decides what to show and how to show it. You can create as many as you want.

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Content sources</h3>
    <p>Build a profile from albums, people, tags, and memories. Sources are combined into one playlist.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Date filters</h3>
    <p>Limit a profile to a fixed range or a rolling window like the last 6 months.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Slideshow controls</h3>
    <p>Change interval, shuffle, transitions, photo motion, and playlist refresh timing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Display settings</h3>
    <p>Choose overlays, clock and weather, date formatting, and background effects.</p>
  </div>

## What you can configure

| Area | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Content | Albums, people, tags, memories, and optional date filtering |
| Playback | Interval, shuffle, transition effect, photo motion, and playlist refresh interval |
| Display | Overlay style and fields, background effect, date and time formatting, weather, and image quality |

When weather is enabled for a profile, you can choose whether the Roku shows temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## Profile planning

The channel and screensaver share the same companion URL, but they can use different profiles.

That means you can:

- use the same profile for both
- give the screensaver its own profile
- keep the normal channel tuned for interactive use and the screensaver tuned for quieter background playback
